**What is RosesCore?** 
Well, RC (or RosesCore) is a custom combat system based on Item Lores developed on top of SkillAPI system. It allows server owners to control their items with ease by simply editing the item lore.

Want a sweeping edge axe? Sure! A recharge on bows? Also possible! Its not nearly finished, but its a good starting point if you wish to extend it. 

RC also includes a class system based on MOBAs, as they are balanced to fair PvP. If you setup it correctly, fights can become pretty fun and intense, based on how players use their powers!
